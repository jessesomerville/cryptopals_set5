# Diffie-Hellman

From the [Diffieâ€”Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) Wikipedia page:

Diffie-Hellman establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used
for secret communication for exchanging data over a public network.

## Algorithm Details

The original implementation of the protocol uses the multiplicative group of
integers modulo *p*, where *p* is prime, and *g* is a prime root modulo *p*.

 1. Alice and Bob publicly agree to use a modulus *p* = 23 and base *g* = 5 (which is a primitive root modulo 23).
 2. Alice chooses a secret integer *a* = 4, then sends it to Bob *A* = *g*<sup>*a*</sup> mod *p*.
    - *A* = 5<sup>4</sup> mod 23 = 4
 3. Bob chooses a secret integer *b* = 3, then sends Alice *B* = *g*<sup>*b*</sup> mod *p*
    - *B* = 5<sup>3</sup> mod 23 = 10
 4. Alice computes *s* = *B*<sup>*a*</sup> mod *p*
    - s = 10<sup>4</sup> mod 23 = 18
 5. Bob computes *s* = *A*<sup>*b*</sup> mod *p*
    - s = 4<sup>3</sup> mod 23 = 18
 6. Alice and Bob now share a secret (the number 18).

Alice and Bob have arrived at the same values because under mod p,

<!-- 
A^b mod p    = g^{ab} mod p
g^{ab} mod p = g^{ba} mod p
g^{ba} mod p = B^a mod p
-->

## MITM Key-fixing attack on DH with parameter injection

This attack works by replacing Alice and Bob's public keys with *p* during the handshake.

 1. Alice and Bob publicly agree to use a modulus *p* = 23 and base *g* = 5 (which is a primitive root modulo 23).
 2. Mike is MITM'ing the connection between Alice and Bob.
 3. Alice sends Mike *p*, *g*, and *A*.
    - *A* = 5<sup>4</sup> mod 23 = 4
 4. Mike replaces *A* with *p* and forwards the message to Bob.
 5. Bob sends Mike *p*, *g*, and *B*.
    - *B* = 5<sup>3</sup> mod 23 = 10
 6. Mike replaces *B* with *p* and sends it to Alice.
 7. Alice computes *s* = *p*<sup>*a*</sup> mod *p*
    - s = 23<sup>4</sup> mod 23 = 0
 8. Bob computes *s* = *p*<sup>*b*</sup> mod *p*
    - s = 23<sup>3</sup> mod 23 = 0

Since the public keys are the same as the prime, the generated number will always be 0.
